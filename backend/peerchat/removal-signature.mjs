// A room's removal list, signed by whoever made the room.
//
// A list used to count only when it came over the creator's own connection.
// Nobody else could pass it on, since a list forwarded by somebody else could
// have been changed on the way. In a room bigger than one device's handful of
// connections most members never meet the creator, so a removal never reached
// them and the person removed went on talking to them.
//
// Signed with the creator's key, a list can come from anyone. Whoever receives
// it checks the signature against the creator key the room already trusts
// (pinned in the app for P2P Republic, or learned from the creator), and a
// newer version replaces an older one. So a removal spreads through the whole
// room, whether the creator is online or not.
//
// The desktop keeps the same rules in peerchat's lib/removal-signature.js.
// Both have to agree on every byte.
