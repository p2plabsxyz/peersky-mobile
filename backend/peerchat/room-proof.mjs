// Being in a room on a connection means holding the room's key, and a peer
// shows that without sending it. The topic a room is found by is public: DHT
// nodes see it go by. So a topic opens nothing on its own. Each side sends,
// for every room it is in, an HMAC made with that room's key over the
// connection's handshake hash and its own network key. Only someone holding
// the key can make one, it is good on this connection alone, and it cannot be
// bounced back, because the other side's would name the other key.
//
// PeerChat on the desktop keeps the same rules in lib/room-proof.js. Both have
// to agree on every byte.
