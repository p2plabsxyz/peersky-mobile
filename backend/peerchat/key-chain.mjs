// Room keys that rotate, so a stolen key cannot read old messages.
//
// A room's key does three things: it names the room, finds its people, and
// proves a device is in it. It used to seal every message as well, for the
// room's whole life, so anyone who got hold of it, from a forwarded invite or a
// lost phone, could read every message they could get a copy of, past and
// future.
//
// A room made on this version still has a key for those three things, but its
// messages are sealed with keys from a chain next to it:
//
// - Time is counted in hours from the Unix epoch.
// - The chain starts with 32 random bytes, made by whoever makes the room or
//   opens the direct message, for the hour it was made.
// - Each hour's secret is an HMAC of the hour before's. Going back from a
//   secret to an earlier one is not possible.
// - An hour's message key is an HMAC of that hour's secret.
// - Somebody joining is given the current hour's secret, never an earlier one,
//   so a newcomer, or anyone holding a stolen invite or a stolen current key,
//   cannot read anything sealed before it. A phone keeps the earliest secret it
//   was given, so its own history stays readable on it.
//
// Rooms made before this have no chain and seal with their room key as they
// always did; older builds can only read those. A room whose key carries the
// mark below has a chain, so the key alone says so, without trusting anyone.
//
// The desktop keeps the same rules in peerchat's lib/key-chain.js. Both have to
// agree on every byte.
